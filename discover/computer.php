	<h1>DurianBook Air</h1>
	Revolutionary, Lightweight Laptop<br>
	DurianBook Air is a thin, lightweight laptop from Durian.  Because it is a full-sized notebook but only weighs three pounds, the laptop falls into a category that vendors are currently calling 'ultraportable.' The MacBook Air has an anodized aluminum casing that is 0.16 inches at its thinnest point and 0.76 inches at its thickest. Often described as the same size as a pad of paper, the laptop has just one USB port, an audio headphone jack and built-in speakers and microphone.
